# üßæ Kithab ‚Äî Academic Notes Management Platform  

**Kithab** is a full-stack (MERN) web platform that streamlines how **students access**, **faculties upload**, and **admins manage** academic notes.  
It provides a clean hierarchical filtering structure ‚Äî *Regulation ‚Üí Branch ‚Üí Semester ‚Üí Subject* ‚Äî ensuring organized storage, quick search, and efficient administration.

---

## üöÄ Overview  

Kithab connects **Students**, **Faculty**, and **Admins** under one structured platform for digital note sharing.  
It focuses on three core workflows:

1. **Students** can search and download notes based on filters.  
2. **Faculties** can upload and manage their own notes.  
3. **Admins** can control regulations, branches, subjects, faculties, and oversee all uploaded content.

JWT-based authentication ensures secure access, with automatic logout upon token expiry.

  - Deleting a *Regulation* removes all its *Branches, Subjects,* and *Notes*.

  Each section has:
  - Add/Edit modals  
  - Confirmation before delete  
  - Timestamps for tracking creation/updates  

#### üìÇ Notes Manager (Admin View)
- **View All Notes:**  
  Displays every note uploaded by all faculties.
- **Filter Controls:**  
  Admin must select all filters (*Regulation ‚Üí Branch ‚Üí Semester ‚Üí Subject*) before the **Get Notes** button is enabled.  
- **Clear Filters Button:**  
  Instantly resets all filter selections.  
- **Download / Delete:**  
  Admin can download or permanently delete any uploaded note.

## Authentication System  

- **JWT-Based Authentication:**  
  - Both Faculty and Admin logins return JWT tokens.
  - Tokens are stored securely in frontend context (not in localStorage for safety).  
  - Tokens auto-expire, and the user is automatically logged out upon expiry.  
- **Role-Based Routing:**  
  - Admins and Faculties see separate dashboards after login.  
  - Students don‚Äôt need authentication for searching and downloading public notes.  

---

## Tech Stack  

**Frontend:** React, React Router, Context API, Axios  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose (MongoDB)  
**Database:** MongoDB  
**Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  
**File Handling:** Binary file upload using MongoDB Buffer storage  

---

## Data Model Overview  

**Core Collections:**
- Regulation  
- Branch (linked to Regulation)  
- Subject (linked to Branch + Semester)  
- Note (linked to Regulation, Branch, Subject, Faculty)  
- Faculty (for authentication)  

Relationships are designed to ensure structured access and safe cascading deletions.

---

## Smart Backend Logic  

- **Transactional Deletions:**  
  When Admin deletes a regulation/branch, all linked data is deleted atomically using MongoDB transactions.
- **Optimized File Fetch:**  
  Notes‚Äô actual binary data is excluded from initial queries and only fetched when the user clicks download.
- **Error Handling:**  
  All backend routes use structured try/catch blocks with meaningful responses.
